aotearoa search
==============

This is a plugin for wordpress that allows you to get a json object when you do search. 
Nothing else, nothing less.

This plugin it's under development. 

I AM NOT RECOMENING TO ANYONE TO USE IT. 

You're  free to download it and have a look around.

There's no interface provided, just a json as result when you search for something on your wordpress.

Why I did this?

- Because I like and I use wordpress.
- Because I wanted to get parsed and formatted data using a simple search query.
- Because json is pretty.
