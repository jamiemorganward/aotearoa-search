wp_search_json
==============

This is a plugin for wordpress that gives me a json object when i do search. 
This plugin, at the moment it's for personal use. 

I AM NOT RECOMENING TO ANYONE TO USE IT. 

I am still developing. Feel free to download it and have a look around. 
There's no interface provided, just a json as result when you search for something on your wordpress.

Why I did this?

- Because I like and I use wordpress.
- Because I wanted to get parsed and formatted data using a simple search query.
- Because json is pretty.
